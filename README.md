# Movie Runtime

 
This project fetches movie data from the [Casino Aschaffenburg](https://www.casino-aschaffenburg.de/) website. Since the site only displays movie starting times, the goal is to calculate and display the end times for the listed movies.

This project also serves as a hands-on opportunity to learn and experiment with Rust.
